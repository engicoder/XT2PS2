# XT2PS2
Converts the IBM Model F PC/XT keyboard to enable communication with PS/2 hosts.

The IBM Model F XT is the original 83 key release with the IBM PC and PC/XT from 1981 to 1983. In 1984, IBM released the IBM PC/AT along with a new 84 key keyboard. The new keyboard used a different communications protocol that the PC/XT. This protocol would form the basis of the PS/2 protocol which became the standard for PC compatibles before the advent of USB. Unfortunately, the PC/XT keyboards are incompatible with computers requiring PS/2 peripherals. 

The XT2PS2 converter is a small hardware adapter that installed within the PC/XT keyboard. It allows the keyboard to communicate with PS/2 host while retaining the original cable. *Note: An AT to PS/2 adapter will have to be used for most PS/2 computers.*
